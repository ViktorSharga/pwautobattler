# PW Autobattler - Successful Implementation Documentation

## Project Overview
A Windows application that successfully automates input for multiple instances of "Asgard Perfect World" (ElementClient.exe) running simultaneously. The application can send keyboard commands to background game windows without requiring them to be in focus.

## Final Working Solution

### Successful Input Method: KeyboardEventOptimized
After extensive testing with multiple input approaches, **KeyboardEventOptimized** proved to be the most effective method for this specific game.

#### Key Features:
- **Minimal Window Flickering**: 10ms focus delay (vs 100ms in standard methods)
- **Proper Game Input Recognition**: Keys are recognized as game hotkeys, not chat input
- **Movement Support**: Proper key hold functionality for movement (W key)
- **Background Operation**: Works on minimized/background windows
- **Fast Response**: 30ms key timing for reliable input

#### Technical Implementation:
```csharp
private bool SendKeyPressKeyboardEventOptimized(IntPtr windowHandle, VirtualKeyCode key)
{
    IntPtr originalForeground = GetForegroundWindow();
    
    // Minimal delay for window focus
    SetForegroundWindow(windowHandle);
    Thread.Sleep(10); // Optimized from 100ms
    
    byte vk = (byte)key;
    byte scan = (byte)MapVirtualKey((uint)key, 0);
    
    keybd_event(vk, scan, 0, UIntPtr.Zero);
    Thread.Sleep(30); // Optimized timing
    keybd_event(vk, scan, KEYEVENTF_KEYUP, UIntPtr.Zero);
    
    SetForegroundWindow(originalForeground);
    return true;
}
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### 1. InputSimulator (`src/Core/InputSimulator.cs`)
- **Purpose**: Handles all keyboard input simulation
- **Methods Implemented**:
  - PostMessage (background messaging)
  - SendMessage (synchronous messaging)
  - SendInput (system-level input)
  - KeyboardEvent (direct keyboard API)
  - ScanCode (scan code only)
  - **KeyboardEventOptimized** (final solution)

#### 2. WindowManager (`src/Core/WindowManager.cs`)
- **Purpose**: Detects and manages ElementClient.exe windows
- **Key Features**:
  - Enumerates all game windows
  - Validates window handles
  - Detects active foreground windows
  - Filters by process name

#### 3. HotkeyManager (`src/Core/HotkeyManager.cs`)
- **Purpose**: Global hotkey registration and handling
- **Hotkeys**:
  - `Ctrl+Shift+1-9/0` - Register window to slots 1-10

#### 4. MainForm (`src/UI/MainForm.cs`)
- **Purpose**: User interface and application control
- **Features**:
  - Window registration display
  - Input method selection
  - Test controls for Q, 1, and W movement
  - Real-time status updates
  - Method testing functionality

### Data Models

#### GameWindow (`src/Models/GameWindow.cs`)
```csharp
public class GameWindow
{
    public int ProcessId { get; set; }
    public IntPtr WindowHandle { get; set; }
    public string WindowTitle { get; set; }
    public int RegistrationSlot { get; set; }
    public bool IsActive { get; set; }
    public DateTime RegisteredAt { get; set; }
}
```

## Input Method Comparison

| Method | Focus Required | Chat Issue | Movement Support | Reliability |
|--------|----------------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| PostMessage | No | Yes | Partial | Low |
| SendMessage | No | Yes | Partial | Low |
| SendInput | Yes | No | Yes | Medium |
| KeyboardEvent | Yes | No | Partial | Medium |
| ScanCode | Yes | No | Yes | Medium |
| **KeyboardEventOptimized** | **Yes** | **No** | **Yes** | **High** |

## Problem Resolution History

### Issue 1: Keys Going to Chat Instead of Game
- **Problem**: Q and 1 keys were being interpreted as chat input
- **Root Cause**: PostMessage/SendMessage don't properly simulate physical keyboard input
- **Solution**: Switched to KeyboardEvent methods that use the Windows keyboard API directly

### Issue 2: Window Flickering
- **Problem**: Constant window focus switching caused visual flickering
- **Root Cause**: 100ms delays in focus switching
- **Solution**: Reduced delays to 10ms and implemented smart focus management

### Issue 3: Movement Not Working
- **Problem**: W key hold for movement wasn't functioning
- **Root Cause**: Key down/up events weren't properly managed
- **Solution**: Implemented held key tracking and proper key state management

```csharp
// Held key tracking
private readonly Dictionary<IntPtr, HashSet<VirtualKeyCode>> _heldKeys = new();

// Smart focus restoration
if (!_heldKeys.ContainsKey(windowHandle) || _heldKeys[windowHandle].Count == 0)
{
    SetForegroundWindow(originalForeground);
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Defensive Use Only
This application is designed for legitimate game automation and testing purposes only. It should not be used for:
- Exploiting game mechanics
- Circumventing anti-cheat systems
- Gaining unfair advantages in competitive play

### Anti-Cheat Compatibility
The KeyboardEventOptimized method simulates physical keyboard input and should be compatible with most anti-cheat systems, but users should verify compliance with their game's terms of service.

## Current Working Features (Updated 2025)

### 1. Broadcast Mode ✅
**Purpose**: Automatically send keystrokes 1-9 to all registered windows when pressed
**Implementation**: 
- Global keyboard hook listens for keys 1-9
- Temporarily disables hook during broadcast to prevent infinite loops
- Uses selected input method (KeyboardEventOptimized recommended)
- Returns focus to window 1 or original window after broadcast

**Technical Details**:
```csharp
// In MainForm.cs - OnGlobalKeyDown
private void OnGlobalKeyDown(object? sender, Keys key)
{
    if (!_broadcastMode) return;
    
    int keyNumber = key switch {
        Keys.D1 => 1, Keys.D2 => 2, Keys.D3 => 3, // ... Keys.D9 => 9
        _ => 0
    };
    
    if (keyNumber > 0) {
        _keyboardHook?.StopListening(); // Prevent infinite loop
        BroadcastKeyToAllWindows(keyNumber);
        if (_broadcastMode) _keyboardHook?.StartListening();
    }
}
```

### 2. Mouse Mirroring (Ctrl+Click) ✅
**Purpose**: Mirror Ctrl+Click mouse events to all registered windows
**Implementation**:
- Low-level mouse hook detects Ctrl+Click combinations
- Converts screen coordinates to client coordinates for each window
- Uses BackgroundMouseSimulator for message-based clicking
- Supports both left and right click mirroring

**Technical Details**:
```csharp
// In MouseHook.cs - HookCallback
bool ctrlPressed = (GetAsyncKeyState(0x11) & 0x8000) != 0;
if (ctrlPressed && wParam == (IntPtr)WM_LBUTTONDOWN) {
    CtrlLeftClick?.Invoke(this, new MouseEventArgs(hookStruct.pt.x, hookStruct.pt.y));
}

// In MainForm.cs - OnCtrlLeftClick  
_backgroundMouseSimulator?.BroadcastMouseClick(windows, e.X, e.Y, 
    BackgroundMouseSimulator.MouseButton.Left);
```

### 3. Shift+Click Double-Click ✅
**Purpose**: Send proper double-click events to all windows when Shift+Click is performed
**Implementation**:
- Enhanced mouse hook detects Shift+Click combinations
- Sends proper Windows double-click message sequence
- Uses WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK instead of two single clicks
- Proper timing ensures game recognition

**Technical Details**:
```csharp
// In BackgroundMouseSimulator.cs - SendMouseDoubleClickPostMessage
private bool SendMouseDoubleClickPostMessage(IntPtr windowHandle, IntPtr lParam, MouseButton button)
{
    var downMsg = button == MouseButton.Left ? WM_LBUTTONDOWN : WM_RBUTTONDOWN;
    var upMsg = button == MouseButton.Left ? WM_LBUTTONUP : WM_RBUTTONUP;
    var dblclkMsg = button == MouseButton.Left ? WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK : WM_RBUTTONDBLCLK;

    // Proper double-click sequence: DOWN -> UP -> DBLCLK -> UP
    PostMessage(windowHandle, (uint)downMsg, IntPtr.Zero, lParam);
    Thread.Sleep(10);
    PostMessage(windowHandle, (uint)upMsg, IntPtr.Zero, lParam);
    Thread.Sleep(10);
    PostMessage(windowHandle, (uint)dblclkMsg, IntPtr.Zero, lParam);
    Thread.Sleep(10);
    PostMessage(windowHandle, (uint)upMsg, IntPtr.Zero, lParam);
    return true;
}
```

### 4. 10-Window Support ✅
**Purpose**: Support up to 10 simultaneous game windows
**Implementation**:
- Registration slots 1-10 mapped to Ctrl+Shift+1-9/0
- Dictionary-based window storage with slot numbers as keys
- UI displays all 10 slots with active/inactive status
- Validation ensures only active windows receive commands

### Background Input Analysis
**Status**: Limited reliability due to Windows security and game input handling
**Working Methods**: 
- PostMessage: Basic functionality, some games ignore
- SendMessage: Synchronous, better reliability than PostMessage
- DirectClient: Enhanced coordinate handling

**Recommended Approach**: Continue using KeyboardEventOptimized for keyboard input (requires focus switching) and background mouse methods for mouse input where possible.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Auto-scan Process Detection**: Automatically find and assign ElementClient processes
2. **Individual Window Testing**: Test connection buttons for each registered slot
3. **Configuration File**: Save/load window registrations
4. **Macro Recording**: Record and replay complex input sequences
5. **Plugin System**: Support for game-specific automation modules

### Code Maintenance
- Regular testing with game updates
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Windows API compatibility updates
- .NET framework updates
